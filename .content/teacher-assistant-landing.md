# Stop wasting time searching for your teaching materials

Ever spent hours hunting through emails, drives, and folders just to find that one worksheet you need for tomorrow's class? You're not alone. Most teachers lose 5-10 hours weekly just organizing and finding digital materials.

The Virtual Teacher Assistant puts an end to this frustration. It's a simple web app built specifically for teachers who are tired of juggling files across multiple platforms. 

No complicated features you'll never use. No steep learning curve. Just a straightforward solution that brings all your teaching resources together in one secure, easy-to-search location.

## Keep all your teaching materials in one place

Stop jumping between Google Drive, Dropbox, your downloads folder, and email attachments. The Virtual Teacher Assistant gives you a single home for all your teaching files.

Upload any file type - worksheets, presentations, videos, images - and organize them your way. Tag resources by subject, grade level, unit, or create custom categories that match how you think.

When you need something, just type what you're looking for. Our smart search finds files not just by name but by content and tags too. That worksheet about photosynthesis? Found in seconds, not minutes.

Teachers tell us they save 3-7 hours every week just by having everything in one searchable place. That's time you can spend on what matters - teaching and taking care of yourself.

## Create and manage virtual classrooms with ease

Setting up virtual classes shouldn't take a computer science degree. Create a new classroom in three clicks, add students from a simple list, and you're ready to go.

Need to track multiple class periods or subjects? No problem. Each virtual classroom keeps student lists, schedules, and materials neatly separated but accessible from your main dashboard.

The built-in calendar shows you what's coming up across all your classes. It syncs with Google Calendar too, so you don't have to maintain two schedules. Add class sessions, parent meetings, or planning blocks with a click.

Unlike bloated learning platforms, there's nothing for you or your students to install. Everything works through a regular web browser on any device - computers, tablets, even phones.

## Track assignments without the complexity

You don't need a full-blown learning management system just to keep track of who's done what. Our simple assignment tracker lets you:

- Create basic assignments in seconds
- Attach relevant files from your library
- Set due dates that show up on your calendar
- Track completion with a simple checkbox system
- Send reminder emails to students who haven't submitted

Students receive a simple link where they can view instructions and upload their work. No accounts needed, no passwords to forget.

For you, everything stays organized by class and student. See at a glance who's on track and who might need extra help - without spending hours managing a complicated system.

## Share resources securely with colleagues

Great teaching materials shouldn't stay locked in one classroom. Share your best resources with teammates without copying files or sending bulky email attachments.

Generate shareable links to any resource in your library. Control exactly what others can do - view only, download, or edit. Set expiration dates for temporary access or keep links active for ongoing collaboration.

For department or grade-level teams, create shared collections that everyone can contribute to. New worksheets, lesson plans, and activities stay organized in one place that updates automatically for all team members.

All sharing happens through secure, encrypted links. Your materials stay private, accessible only to the specific people you choose to share with.
